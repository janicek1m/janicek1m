### Hi, I'm Janice ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising second year at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and minoring in Design. Currently, I'm interested in tech for social good, design and visual culture, and linguistics.

At Penn, I'm apart of [Hack4Impact](https://hack4impact.org/), where I help build nonprofit software as a developer. I hope to build technologies that can be used to uplift others and encourage action. In Fall of 2020, I was a technical developer on the [Here to Serve](https://www.heretoserve.org/) project, which produced a completely revamped volunteer management system. In Spring of 2021, I was a technical developer and designer working on an interactive map for the [Black Innovation Alliance](https://blackinnovationalliance.com/).

I'm super passionate about uplifting underrepresented communities in computer science. For the past 3 years, I've worked as an Instructor Assistant and Campus Facilitator for [Kode With Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com/), where I supported scholars by leading an 8-week, virtual intensive teaching web development to high school girls.

This summer, I'm working at the [American Civil Liberties Union](https://www.aclu.org/) as a Software Engineering Intern for the Educate Pod in the Project & Technology Team. 

When I'm not coding, I love exploring design, discovering new artists, and trying new recipes!
