### Hi, I'm Janice ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Currently, I'm interested in tech for social good, design and visual culture, and linguistics.

At Penn, I'm apart of [Hack4Impact](https://hack4impact.org/), where I help build nonprofit software as a developer. I hope to build technologies that can be used to uplift others and encourage action. In Fall of 2020, I was a technical developer on the [Here to Serve](https://www.heretoserve.org/) project, which produced a completely revamped volunteer management system. Currently, I'm a technical developer and designer working on an interactive map for the Black Innovation Alliance.

In addition, I'm currently working as an Campus Facilitator for [Hack4Impact](https://www.kodewithklossy.com/), where I support scholars by leading an 8-week, virtual intensive teaching web development to high school girls.

When I'm not coding, I love exploring design, discovering new artists, and trying new recipes!
